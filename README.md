# BIO539_project
This anlaysis utilizes data from collected in a 2019 paper examining the relationship between shorebird energy expendature and near-by human disturbance. 
These data were obtained from the Dryad Digital Repository at the following location: 
  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.74vm25v

The "header.txt" file was created to fix issues of figures cutting off captions and moving to different locations when knit from the Rmarkdown file. The text was copied from an online user. SOURCE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51582345/image-position-in-r-markdown/56949568#56949568

The intention of this test was, primarily, to explore the data from a shorebird related study. With limited statistical knowledge, it was the intention of this project to simply work through these results and to test this researcher's knowledge of R programming and ability to produce accurate figures with the available data. 

The shorebird_project.R file is annotated in the interest of reproducibility, but there are no functions involved that require specific instructions.
